# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for setting up the infrastructure and base implementation of FisioFlow 2.0, a comprehensive physiotherapy clinic management system. The system will serve physiotherapists, patients, and partner healthcare providers through dedicated portals, with a focus on Brazilian healthcare compliance (LGPD) and clinical workflow optimization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a development team, I want to establish the foundational infrastructure for FisioFlow 2.0, so that we can build a scalable and maintainable clinic management system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL have a properly configured React TypeScript project with Vite
2. WHEN the infrastructure is set up THEN the system SHALL integrate with Supabase for backend services (database, authentication, storage)
3. WHEN the deployment pipeline is configured THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to Vercel with continuous integration
4. WHEN the mobile app preparation is done THEN the system SHALL be configured for CapacitorJS integration for iOS deployment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized project structure, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices for a large-scale application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project structure is created THEN the system SHALL organize components by functionality (pages, components, services, hooks)
2. WHEN the folder structure is implemented THEN the system SHALL separate concerns between different user portals (therapist, patient, partner)
3. WHEN the base structure is ready THEN the system SHALL include proper TypeScript configuration with path aliases
4. WHEN the architecture is established THEN the system SHALL follow the service layer pattern for API interactions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable UI components and API services, so that I can efficiently build consistent interfaces and maintain clean code architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI foundation is created THEN the system SHALL provide generic components (buttons, modals, cards, forms)
2. WHEN the styling system is configured THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS for consistent design
3. WHEN the API layer is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide services for Supabase communication
4. WHEN the form system is ready THEN the system SHALL integrate React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper authentication and routing, so that different user types can access their appropriate portals securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is implemented THEN the system SHALL support role-based access control for different user types
2. WHEN routing is configured THEN the system SHALL provide protected routes for each portal (therapist, patient, partner)
3. WHEN the navigation is set up THEN the system SHALL include proper layout components for each portal
4. WHEN security is implemented THEN the system SHALL comply with LGPD requirements for data protection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper development tooling and testing setup, so that I can maintain code quality and catch issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development environment is configured THEN the system SHALL include proper linting and formatting tools
2. WHEN the testing framework is set up THEN the system SHALL support unit and integration testing with Vitest
3. WHEN the build process is configured THEN the system SHALL optimize for production deployment
4. WHEN the development workflow is established THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading and fast development cycles
