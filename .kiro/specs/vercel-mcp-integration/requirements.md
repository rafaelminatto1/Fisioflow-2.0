# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with Vercel in the FisioFlow 2.0 system. The implementation will enable seamless communication between the application and Vercel's infrastructure through MCP, providing enhanced deployment capabilities, real-time monitoring, and automated optimization features while following industry best practices for security and performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure MCP for Vercel integration, so that the application can communicate effectively with Vercel's infrastructure and services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP configuration is set up THEN the system SHALL establish secure communication channels with Vercel APIs
2. WHEN MCP client is initialized THEN the system SHALL authenticate properly with Vercel using secure credentials
3. WHEN MCP connection is established THEN the system SHALL maintain persistent connection with proper error handling
4. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL securely manage Vercel API tokens and MCP settings
5. WHEN MCP tools are registered THEN the system SHALL provide access to Vercel deployment and monitoring capabilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment management through MCP, so that deployments can be triggered, monitored, and managed programmatically with best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is triggered through MCP THEN the system SHALL initiate Vercel deployment with proper configuration
2. WHEN deployment status is queried THEN the system SHALL provide real-time deployment progress and status information
3. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggested remediation steps
4. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL automatically update deployment records and notify relevant stakeholders
5. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL provide safe rollback capabilities through MCP commands

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time monitoring and analytics through MCP, so that application performance and health can be tracked and optimized automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL collect real-time performance metrics from Vercel
2. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger automated alerts and optimization suggestions
3. WHEN analytics data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive deployment and usage statistics
4. WHEN errors occur in production THEN the system SHALL automatically collect and report error details through MCP
5. WHEN optimization opportunities are identified THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure MCP implementation with proper authentication and authorization, so that Vercel integration maintains security best practices and compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP credentials are managed THEN the system SHALL use secure storage and rotation mechanisms
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting and retry strategies
3. WHEN sensitive data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use encrypted communication channels
4. WHEN access control is needed THEN the system SHALL implement role-based permissions for MCP operations
5. WHEN audit logging is required THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive logs of all MCP interactions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want MCP integration with existing development workflow, so that Vercel capabilities are seamlessly integrated into the current development and deployment processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development commands are executed THEN the system SHALL integrate MCP operations with existing CLI workflows
2. WHEN CI/CD pipelines run THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger appropriate MCP operations
3. WHEN local development occurs THEN the system SHALL provide MCP tools for testing and preview deployments
4. WHEN team collaboration is needed THEN the system SHALL share MCP capabilities across development team members
5. WHEN documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on MCP usage and best practices

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance optimization through MCP, so that the application can automatically benefit from Vercel's optimization features and recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL use MCP to access Vercel's optimization tools
2. WHEN build optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL automatically apply Vercel's recommended configurations
3. WHEN caching strategies are evaluated THEN the system SHALL implement optimal caching through Vercel's CDN
4. WHEN resource optimization is identified THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize assets and delivery
5. WHEN performance regression is detected THEN the system SHALL provide automated remediation suggestions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery for MCP operations, so that Vercel integration remains reliable and provides graceful degradation when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP connection fails THEN the system SHALL implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
2. WHEN API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue operations and retry with appropriate delays
3. WHEN Vercel services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms and user notifications
4. WHEN MCP operations timeout THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully without blocking other operations
5. WHEN error recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery instructions
