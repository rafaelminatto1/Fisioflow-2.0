# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing the FisioFlow 2.0 system for Vercel deployment and Supabase integration, focusing on eliminating current deployment errors and improving system performance. The optimization will address build failures, runtime errors, and performance bottlenecks that are currently preventing successful deployment to Vercel.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve all Vercel deployment errors, so that the application can be successfully deployed and accessed by users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL compile without TypeScript errors or warnings
2. WHEN Vercel deployment is triggered THEN the system SHALL complete the build process without failures
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL start without runtime errors in the production environment
4. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL properly load all required configuration for Vercel deployment
5. WHEN the routing is tested THEN the system SHALL handle HashRouter navigation correctly in the Vercel environment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized Supabase integration, so that database operations are fast, reliable, and don't cause deployment or runtime issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase client is initialized THEN the system SHALL connect efficiently without blocking the application startup
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL handle connection pooling and rate limiting appropriately
3. WHEN authentication is performed THEN the system SHALL manage Supabase auth state without causing memory leaks
4. WHEN real-time subscriptions are used THEN the system SHALL properly clean up connections to prevent resource exhaustion
5. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL securely manage Supabase credentials for production deployment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized build configuration, so that the application builds quickly and efficiently for Vercel deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Vite build runs THEN the system SHALL optimize bundle size and eliminate unused code
2. WHEN assets are processed THEN the system SHALL compress images and optimize static resources
3. WHEN dependencies are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify and resolve circular dependencies
4. WHEN the build output is generated THEN the system SHALL create optimized chunks for better loading performance
5. WHEN source maps are generated THEN the system SHALL balance debugging capability with build size

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and monitoring, so that deployment issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in production THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and stack traces
2. WHEN the application fails to load THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback UI
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL handle Supabase errors gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN build errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information for debugging
5. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL include monitoring capabilities to identify bottlenecks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance optimizations, so that the application loads quickly and provides a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL achieve fast initial page load times through code splitting
2. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL minimize unnecessary re-renders and optimize React performance
3. WHEN data is fetched THEN the system SHALL implement efficient caching strategies for Supabase queries
4. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading and optimized formats
5. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL maintain good Core Web Vitals scores for SEO and user experience

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated development and deployment guidelines, so that the team can avoid common pitfalls and maintain deployment stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new code is written THEN the system SHALL enforce coding standards that prevent deployment errors
2. WHEN Vercel-specific configurations are needed THEN the system SHALL include proper vercel.json settings
3. WHEN Supabase integration patterns are used THEN the system SHALL follow best practices for connection management
4. WHEN environment variables are managed THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for production setup
5. WHEN deployment workflows are established THEN the system SHALL include automated checks to prevent broken deployments
