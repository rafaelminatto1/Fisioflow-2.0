# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the comprehensive elimination of all TypeScript errors in the Fisioflow 2.0 codebase. The project currently has 235 TypeScript errors across 61 files, which need to be systematically resolved to ensure type safety, code quality, and maintainability. The errors range from missing type definitions, incorrect type assignments, undefined property access, and configuration issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript errors to be eliminated from the codebase, so that I can work with a type-safe and maintainable application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run type-check` THEN the system SHALL return zero TypeScript errors
2. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL compile successfully without type errors
3. WHEN importing modules THEN the system SHALL resolve all module paths correctly
4. WHEN accessing object properties THEN the system SHALL ensure all properties are properly typed and defined

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper type definitions for all external libraries and services, so that I can use them with full TypeScript support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Google GenAI library THEN the system SHALL have correct type definitions and usage patterns
2. WHEN using Capacitor plugins THEN the system SHALL have proper type definitions for all plugin methods
3. WHEN using React Router DOM THEN the system SHALL follow the correct import and usage patterns
4. WHEN using Supabase services THEN the system SHALL handle nullable types correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service layer functions to have proper error handling and type safety, so that runtime errors are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service functions return data THEN the system SHALL handle nullable and undefined values properly
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL have proper error handling with typed responses
3. WHEN using async/await patterns THEN the system SHALL handle Promise types correctly
4. WHEN accessing nested object properties THEN the system SHALL use optional chaining where appropriate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React components to have proper TypeScript interfaces and prop types, so that component usage is type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining component props THEN the system SHALL have proper TypeScript interfaces
2. WHEN using React hooks THEN the system SHALL have correct type definitions for state and effects
3. WHEN handling form data THEN the system SHALL ensure all form fields are properly typed
4. WHEN using context providers THEN the system SHALL have proper type definitions for context values

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all configuration and utility files to be properly typed, so that the entire codebase maintains type consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using configuration files THEN the system SHALL have proper type definitions for all config options
2. WHEN using utility functions THEN the system SHALL have proper input and output types
3. WHEN exporting modules THEN the system SHALL avoid duplicate exports and naming conflicts
4. WHEN using path aliases THEN the system SHALL resolve all module imports correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript configuration to be optimized for the project needs, so that type checking is effective without being overly restrictive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring TypeScript THEN the system SHALL use appropriate strict mode settings
2. WHEN excluding files THEN the system SHALL only exclude files that are not part of the main application
3. WHEN setting compiler options THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with React 19 and modern TypeScript features
4. WHEN using path mapping THEN the system SHALL correctly resolve all @/* imports
